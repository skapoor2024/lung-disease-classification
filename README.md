# lung-disease-classification

Goal: Design and train deep learning classifiers that takes an x-ray image as the input and
assigns the input image to one of the four classes: COVID-19 positive, Normal, Lung Opacity,
Viral Pneumonia.

Dataset: The COVID-19 Radiography Database, which is a database of chest X-ray images of
3616 COVID-19 positive, 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and
1345 Viral Pneumonia case

Train ResNet50, VGG16 and GoogleNet using cross entropy,weighted cross entropy and focal loss.
